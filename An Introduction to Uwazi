To manage records and documents, most organizations today use folders or categories on platforms like DropBox, One Drive and Google Drive so that staff can access them later.  Although safe and effective, these platforms simply provide a safe space for these documents and provide no connections or analysis. 
What if organising documents could make their contents come alive? Uwazi goes beyond tags and filenames to organise your documents. Each document can be critical is telling a story: an email that asks for a favor from a politician, a testimony from a witness of police violence, the ruling of a court on a human rights case. When these stories are connected by the platform, the bigger picture of patterns and systems becomes clearer: ongoing corruption, systematic police violence, legal human rights precedence and abuse of power. 
Uwazi is built to do exactly this â€“ highlight and organise the important information in each document, and create relationships between documents. Uwazi illuminates the bigger picture that human rights document collections uncover.
